# The Ultimate Audio/Video Engineers Toolkit in one Device

Imagine a laptop that has contained with it a 12x12 Audio Mixing Matrix. 

All analog Voltage Controlled Amplifiers Digitally controlled by the computer.

D/A's A/D's and DSP all located around the CPU, reduce latency. If Intel would develop a chip with the DSP and DAAD package built into one of their processors, that would be better.

All +4dBV Professional Audio Paths, High Quality Connectors, German Components.

Expensive Laptop.

Lets Make it more Expensive. 8 HD-SDI Inputs, 4 HD-SDI Outputs, switching scaling effects, only the Program Video path is Encoded. 2 HDMI Outs.

Timecode Generator SEMPTE, Accurate Clock, SPDIF, DMX512, Black Bar Gen. Integrated Wireless Microphone Reciever X2.

Yes it will be large and heavy. But isn't all audio equipment. It will have not have a battery. Too many voltages in audio/video that have to be discreet and clean. 

Touchscreen.

Have I just described the ultimate audio/video engineers toolkit, or what?

Let's build it, kickstart if necessarry and release to the public as open-source. 
Yeah, we will manufacture the laptop. But it will be built with open parts, and you can build your own from open parts.
